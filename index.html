        Like a withering flower, <br>

         feelings <br>
                          
                thoughts <br>
                            
                    emotions <br>

                            crumpled up as if they were nothing

                                                
                                i was nothing

                                                       
                                        as i lied in a bed of branches
                                                                      
                                        
                                                                        with the hope of seeing you 

                                                                                            but i need wait no more


                                                                 as the dew of your breath 

                                                touches the ground


                        touches me <br> 
                        <center> and the world <br><br><br>my world, 
                            
                            
                            <br>blossoms <br>

i cant wait
for you to come
youâ€™ve been the only thing on my mind
as of lately
and the feeling i get
when im about to meet you
triumphs all ofher emotions
you make me forget about
her
them
it

everything that ripped me up
i suffered without you
i grieved without you
i couldnt think without you
but now that your here
i can forget
about everything
and everyone
what they meant to me
what they felt with me
i hear your footsteps at my door
i jolt up
running down the stairs to open the door
but then i start to slow down
do i want this joy to end this way
has every thought
led to this moment
but your knocking at the door
i cant wait now
theres nothing to worry about when you take me
-

i open the door
i look at you and smile
its love.


i waited all my life for you
why didnt you come earlier
i always wanted to leave this place
and now that your here


I can't wait  to love.

where are you
i need you
i tried to push you away
but i cant anymore
no days go by without me seeing you
always there with that plain look
your shiny eyes
slick body
smooth edge
makes me want to share you with everyone
but your special to me
special to only me
u were always there
when i was alone
you gave me emotion
when i was dead inside
i felt something with you
whether it was good or bad
it was still something
something
i wish i could feel
again
tuats why i have to come back
to you
im alone
its dark
theres no light
i want to take you
and draw with you
draw all the things you did to me
all they said to me
i want you to recreate every scar 
wound
that they did to my hearrt
but to me
i need you
i need to draw again
draw in red
all over myself
without u there is no emotion
you help me relive my happier days
the dull blade
reminds me of the pain
when i was shattered into a million pieces 
and here i am
in the dark
alone
but i found you
and now we can draw in peace
alone
until theres nothing to draw anymore

there i lie
in a pool of my self
thinking about what led up to this moment
im about to loose myself forever
at least let me remember 
all the good things
i was so happy
we laughed
shared our true feelings
cried
but all my thoughts are fading fast
maybe there was somethijg good
what have i done
i dig through my thoughts
there was still hope
there still is hope
i slowly drag myself out
im not about to leave forever
theres still things to fight for
right?
things to live for
right?
i drop the blade i was holding
i try to gain control of my life as it pours out 
i close my eyes for a second
but jolt them open
there you all are
laughing
im laughing too
this feeling fills me 
i walk around looking for you
i see you
everything i yearned for
i reach out 
your fading fast 
but i feel you
the warmth in me
comes back
and i close my eyes
resting in the pool of blood 
with a smile on my face
